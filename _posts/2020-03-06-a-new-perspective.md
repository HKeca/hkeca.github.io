I’m finally growing! My perspective is finally changing, and I think that's a good thing. Before I wouldn’t give anything I didn’t know or understand the time of day. If something seemed wrong, it was just that. Wrong. I didn't ask why it felt that way, or why it happened. Now I don't act on emotions I take a minute or a couple of days to reflect, which might be a bad thing but for now it seems to be working better.

Pairing more. I finally understand the value of pairing. The switch from solving problems on my own to breaking them down with others’ has been amazing. Which has also helped me understand problems on their own better, being able to describe a problem to someone requires you to understand the context. Understanding this context often leads to a path of finding the problem. Also gathering other views on the problem usually gives you more paths. More options for a better solution, more to compare and contrast. 

Gaining a new mindset. Accessibility. Providing content for everyone, something I’ve never even thought about. Going back through HTML and really digging into the basics I’ve found so much that I’ve missed. Using landmark elements to section content, using headers correctly, only using a <div> when it's necessary because usually there is a better element to use. When building like this, among other things, you end up providing a better experience overall. I think just being aware of accessibility options is great in itself. Having this new toolkit in my brain has been awesome.
