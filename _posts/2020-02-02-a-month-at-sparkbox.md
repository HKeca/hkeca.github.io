So it has been just about a month since I started as an apprentice at SparkBox. I’ve met a ton of new faces and learned so much since this is my first in-office job. My main challenge for this apprenticeship is to collaborate as much as possible and get used to working on development teams. So far it has been going well, I’ve learned how to point cards, how to merge branches using a rebase workflow, and I’m in the process of learning how to get better at technical speaking. Taking a deeper look and reflecting, communication has always been my biggest flaw. I don’t have a problem finding topics to bring up, but it’s that part of being able to completely understand a topic to the point that you can put it in layman terms. That’s always been something I’ve struggled with, I can talk to a developer no problem but once I get in a room of mixed backgrounds it all goes to hell.

Story points; This is something I’ve been missing my whole career as a developer so far. I knew the flow of creating cards and issues as far as general project management workflows. I was just having trouble being able to consistently finish cards because I couldn’t predict how much effort it would take. Seeing this process of being able to identify which cards would take more effort than others was mind-blowing, like the key to a puzzle I’ve been missing this whole time yet it was right there built into common tools like Jira.

Communication; I’ve always struggled with taking advanced topics and making them more understandable to non-developers. This is a pretty big deal because throughout life you will be communicating with business people who want to understand the _why_ and impact a new idea will bring. Being able to explain why a framework or a pattern might bring better results down the line with a bit of an upfront cost. Taking a step back, however, it’s not always business talk. Learning to express your thoughts clearly will help outside of work as well. Talking to support agents when you have a problem, being able to handle conflict with others.
